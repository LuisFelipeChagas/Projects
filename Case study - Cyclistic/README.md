# Case study - Cyclistic
 Data analysis case study, using language R, for data manipulation and inicial analysis, and Power BI for visualization.
 
 This case study contains the following files:
   1. **cyclistic.R:** R code, with data manipulation and inicial analysis.
   2. **R-Markdown_Cyclistic.html:** R Markdown file, with step-by-step explanation of the R code.
   3. **Case study report - Cyclistic.pdf:** Report detailing the entire case study data analysis process.
   
It's not possible to share the dashboard file (Power BI) in GitHub, so I added a link in Goolge Drive for access.
